      <a href="index.html"> <sub> HOME </sub> </a>
    </h1>
    <p> Students face so many difficulties before and after joining campas. Especially
      after they have joined campas, their are so many things to block their path.
      We can mainly clasify those difficulties in to three:
      <ol>
        <li> <a href="#peer presure"> peer presure </a> </li>
        <li> <a href="page 3.html"> social media </a> </li>
        <li> <a href="page 3.html" , "#Environment"> Environmental curcumstances </a>          </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p> Everyone has his own plan/objective when he join higher education institutes.
      But only the strongest and lucky ones are able to achive their goal. Many
      students drop out at different level for so many reasons. As a result litracy
      rate of ethiopia is low. For example the following table shows litracy rate
      in 2018:</p>
    <table border "0">
      <tr>
        <td> Total </td>
        <td> 51.77% </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Male </td>
        <td> 59.24% </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Female </td>
        <td> 44.42% </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    </h3>
    <p> If students are not strong enough to block influences coming from all directions,
      anyone can take them in a way that does not suit them. So they can not be
      able to achive what they want and what they can. Influence from outside starts
      even before joining campas when they are chosing their their field of study.
      Their parents tells them what they must study, even if they do not want to
      join that profesion. Others also will tells them to study another field.
      So even if they want to study what others told them, it is not easy to make
      all of them happy. Therefore what they have to do is choosing what they really
      want and what really makes them happy.
      <br> The following short story can easily show how we can not make everyone happy
      at the same time:
       <i> <h4 style="text-align: center;color: darkslategray;"> The child and his father </h4> 
 <p style="color:darkslategray;">once upon a time there was a child who always tries to make happy the people around him.
 His father told him not to do that and always to do what he think it is right. But the child does not listen his father
 and always tries his best for others happiness.
 But he never succed once since everyone wants different things.<br>
 one day his father wants to teach him a lesson and call him for a walk with a donkey. 
 When they went out of their home,the father told his son that the should
 sat on the donkey. The sat on it and began their jorney. After they walk a little they heard
 people saying "How can both of them sat on the donkey? Doesn't they feel sorry for it?
 how cruel are they?" Then the father told his son to sit on the donkey alone and he starts walking by foot.
 After some time they heard other people saying "How can the child sat on donkey while his father walk by foot Doesn't he respect his father?
 what a shame?" Then the father says for his son, "son, you heard them. They are still critisizing us. so let me sit on
 the donkey and you walk by foot." They did as the father said and continue their jorney. while passing a certain village, They heard the people
 saying "what kind of father is he? how can he sat on a donkey while his little child is walking by foot?" Then the father told his son that both
 of them should by foot. Again after some time they heard people
 critisizing them, "Why are they waking by foot,when they have a donkey? what a foolish are they?"
 Finally the father said to his son "son, as you have seen we can't avoid critisizm, what ever we did.
 So don't try to make everyone happy, Do what really makes you happy"</i> </>
