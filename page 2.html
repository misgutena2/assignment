    <p style="text-decoration: orchid;"> After joining universities, students highly influenced by their peers. Every
      action they perform is not what they wanted. Because of this many students
      lose their path in life and are forced to drop out. </p>
    <p> If we take university as a boiling water we can classify students into three:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> The carrot students </li>
      <li> The egg students </li>
      <li> The coffee students </li>
      <br>

      <ol>
        <li> <span style="color:blue;"><b> The carrot students:</b></span> As we all know carrot is a vegetable which
          is strong before it is cooked. After we put it in a boiling water, it
          will become soft and will be broken easily. Like this some students became
          weak after joining campas by peer presure and they become broken easily.
          <table border "1">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="carrot 1.png" width="150" height="150"> </td>
              <td>
                <img src="carrot 2.png" width="150" height="150"> </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </li>
        <li><span style="color:blue;"> <b> The egg students:</b></span> egg is weak and can be easily broken if it fails.
          But after it is cooked, it will become strong and no more broken easily.
          Some students are also like the egg. Becoming strong and block any influence
          coming their way.
          <table border="1">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="egg 1.png" width="150" height="150"> </td>
              <td>
                <img src="egg 2.png" width="150" height="150"> </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <li> <span style="color:blue;"><b> The coffee students:</b></span> coffee will change the color of the water
            when we put it in a boiling water. students who can change their environment
            are environment are catagorized in this group.
            <table border "1">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <img src="coffee.png" width="150" height="150"> </td>
                <td>
                  <img src="coffee 2.png" width="150" height="150"> </td>
              </tr>
